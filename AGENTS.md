# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
Follow production-grade standards. Prioritize:
- maintainability
- readability
- accessibility
- consistency

Default:
- small, focused changes
- no unrelated rewrites
- preserve existing structure/APIs

---

## Working Mode

### Default (Build / Edit)
- Implement only what is requested.
- Inspect nearby patterns first.
- Keep diffs small and scoped.
- Do not run build/compile/lint.
- Do not refactor broadly.
- Suggest verification if relevant.

### Verification (Explicit Only)
Only when explicitly requested:
- verify, lint, compile, build, validate

- Run only relevant checks.
- Do not expand scope.
- Report:
  - what was verified
  - commands run
  - failures / gaps

---

## Core Rules
- No breaking changes unless asked.
- No large unrelated rewrites.
- No unnecessary dependencies.
- Reuse existing helpers/components first.
- Keep APIs stable.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Small, single-purpose functions.
- Avoid deep nesting (use guard clauses).
- Remove obvious duplication when touching code.
- No premature abstractions.

---

## Architecture
- Follow existing structure and naming.
- Keep business logic out of UI.
- Separate:
  - UI
  - state/data
  - business logic
  - utilities

---

## Component System
- Use helpers from `include/functions.php`:
  - `component(...)`

---

## PHP Conventions
- Use `snake_case`.
- Page templates:
  - `$page_title`
  - `$page_current`
- In PHP view files, declare static data and component configuration arrays in one PHP block at the top,
  before HTML or component rendering. Keep the markup below easy to scan.
- Preserve array values, order, and existing component APIs when moving them. Leave arrays that depend on
  loop variables or render-time state beside the code that needs them.
- Follow global formatting rules.

---

## Formatting (Non-Negotiable)
- 2 spaces. No tabs. Never mix.
- Consistent indentation.
- Align `=` and `=>` when grouped.
- Align closing braces.
- Prefer 100–120 char lines.
- Use multi-line arrays/objects when needed.
- Use trailing commas where valid.

---

## Template Guardrails (Non-Negotiable)
- No dynamic tag rendering (`<?= $*_tag; ?>`).
- Use static semantic HTML unless asked.
- Avoid new variables, loops, helpers, or flexible APIs unless required to implement or fix the requested behavior safely.
- Only implement what is requested.
- Do not modify existing classes unless asked.
- If assumptions are needed, ask first.

---

## JS Class Hooks (Non-Negotiable)
- All JS-related class hooks must use this format:
  - `.js-component-block-name`
- JS hook classes must be placed at the end of the `class` attribute (not at the beginning or middle).
- Exception:
  - If the element has a single class only, the JS hook can be that single class.

---

## Styling
- Use Tailwind as default.
- Prefer utility classes + existing components.
- Extract to CSS only when necessary.
- Avoid duplicate logic between Tailwind and CSS.
- No unnecessary CSS.
- Remove obsolete CSS when markup changes.
- Scope styles to component blocks.
- Avoid modifying existing class values unless required to implement or fix the requested change.
- Update Tailwind config only when required.
- Do not run CSS builds unless asked.
- If Tailwind classes, theme tokens, or CSS files change, remind the user to run CSS compile/watch.

---

## Component Changes
When updating reusable components:
1. Update implementation.
2. Update call sites only if needed.
3. Update demos only if needed.
4. Update Tailwind config only if required.
5. Run verification only if asked.
6. Report changes.

---

## Documentation (When Needed)
Only when necessary:
- JS: non-trivial behavior → purpose + required DOM hooks
- PHP: reusable/changed components → Component, Purpose, Structure, Data
- CSS: only non-obvious patterns

## UI Guardrails

- Always reuse existing components in `/views/components` first.
- Treat existing components as the source of truth for UI structure and styling.
- Do not invent new visual patterns, layouts, variants, or interaction styles without explicit approval.
- Prefer existing helper APIs (`component(...)`) over raw custom markup.
- Before implementation, inspect relevant existing components and align with their naming, spacing, and behavior.
- If existing components are not enough, stop and propose the smallest safe extension before writing code.
- Do not redesign, restyle, or “improve” existing UI unless explicitly requested.

# AGENTS.md

## Design System Priority
- Follow the existing design system and UI patterns already present in this repository.
- Reuse existing components before creating new UI.
- Do not introduce new visual patterns, spacing rules, radius, shadows, or interaction styles unless explicitly requested.
- Match the current typography, spacing rhythm, border treatment, and component conventions.

## Component Reuse Rules
- Check `/views/components` first before writing new markup.
- Prefer existing helpers:
  - `component(...)`
- If an existing component is close, extend its API only if explicitly requested.
- If no existing component fits, stop and propose the closest reusable options first.

## Page Building Rules
- When creating a new page, assemble it from existing sections/components as much as possible.
- Keep the page visually consistent with existing pages.
- Do not redesign the system while implementing the page.
- Do not invent new card, button, form, badge, table, or nav styles without approval.

## Styling Rules
- Use Tailwind CSS as the primary styling system.
- Do not replace existing classes or tokens unless required by the task.
- Respect existing spacing scale, container width, and responsive behavior.
- Avoid one-off visual styling if an existing utility pattern already exists.

## Output Rules
- Before coding, inspect relevant existing pages/components.
- State which existing components/patterns will be reused.
- Do not run CSS compile/build unless explicitly asked; remind the user when CSS needs recompiling.
- If the design system is insufficient, pause and propose options instead of improvising.
